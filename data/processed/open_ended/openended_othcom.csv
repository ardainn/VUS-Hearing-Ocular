"Majority of disease variants do not have functional study associated. Yet, lab working on mutant function is rare. Encouragement of performing functional study by increasing funding is necessary to generate more mutant function data. Once function is identified, developing therapeutics will be much easier. There are too many attempts to develop therapeutics without the functional knowledge of how the mutation is affecting the system.  "
