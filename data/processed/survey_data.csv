The data are still scattered everywhere and reading into the level of experimental quality is challenging. The Brnich et al. PS3/BS3 guideline was quite clear to establish the level of expected stringency in order to apply various strengths. It is almost impossible to achieve strong evidence without testing an impressive number of variants in parallel (as done in a MAVE assay) for a gene with reasonably many clear P/LP and B/LB variants. I struggle that the official list of approved assays for a limited subset of hearing loss-associated genes is so few and PS3 requires a KI mouse model recapitulating the phenotype, which is hardly going to be possible at the scale needed, when labs are also encouraged to reduce use of animal models. Although major community efforts have been underway for a long time and have come a long way, there is still clear room for further clarification. With more clarity on guidelines, I think some time would be saved. If better documentation would be required for functional data depositing/annotation, this would also be great - but not only that, there has to be clarity on how to complete documentation so it is as uniform as possible. Further education is badly needed, as it is still the case that two labs classify variants differently (but we are slowly getting better and I hope the new ACMG guidelines will also be a big help with this!).",2
